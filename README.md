# ðŸ§° Project Templates

This repository contains reusable Python project templates designed for quickly starting new machine learning projects. Each template includes a standard structure with:

- `src/` for source code
- `tests/` for unit tests (using `pytest`)
- `notebooks/` for experiments
- `setup.py` for easy imports and packaging
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub.
2. Name your new repository (e.g., `ml-linear-regression`).
3. Clone it and start coding!

## ðŸ“¦ Ideal For

- ML concept-based projects
- Reproducible experiments
- Modular and testable code structure

Happy building!
